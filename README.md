# Game-of-Things

### Resources 
- https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/how-to-create-a-react--flask-project 


### Running the project 
This project has a Flask Python API (backend) and React App (frontend). 
You can technically run either separately (i.e. to just test the api, or to work on the frontend without data), but most of the time you will want to run both. 

1. Startup the API 
- cd into client/game-of-things-app 
> yarn start_api 

2. Run the React App - do this in a seperate terminal window 
- cd into client/game-of-things-app
> yarn start
